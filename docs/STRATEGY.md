*   **Proof:** "We built REXZA and Taleem Space."
*   **Tone:** Futuristic, Fast, Elite.

## 2. One-Page Architecture (The "Impact" Page)
To ship in 2 days, we build a **Single Page Application (SPA)** with scroll-snap sections.

### Section 1: Hero (The Hook)

*   **Subhead:** "AI-Native Design & Development Studio."
*   **Visual:** Abstract 3D shape (Hexagon/Bracket) floating in a neon void.

### Section 2: Ventures (The Proof)
*   **Format:** Large, tilt-effect cards (Apple TV style).

*   **Card C:** **Stealth.** "Coming Soon." (Blurred).

### Section 3: Services (The Offer)

### Section 4: Founder / About (The Trust)
